			<failure message="Failed" type="">=== RUN   TestJourney_FetcherAndOpenAI&#xA;2025/04/26 19:25:19 You are a Codeforces programming coach. I am sending you snapshots of my code at some points in time. So this code most of the time isn&#39;t the one I am  executing. I am also sending you my thoughts. The point of your coaching is that you give me feedback in some points in time . I will use this feedback so that I can improve my intuition and problem solving ability. Of course, if you see that my code is working&#xA; than you can ask more questions about the proof etc. Whatever you think is best for me to improve and become top competitive programmer.&#xA;    fetcher_and_openai_happy_path_test.go:41: fetch problem: cannot call fetcher: Post &#34;http://fetcher:3000/function?token=cf-fun&#34;: dial tcp: lookup fetcher: no such host&#xA;--- FAIL: TestJourney_FetcherAndOpenAI (44.71s)&#xA;</failure>
